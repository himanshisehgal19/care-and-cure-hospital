# Care-and-Cure-Hospital Project
This project is a hospital managment and disease prediction project .It consists of 2 login parts the first one is for Patients and Other login is for Doctor
When a patient will login a disease predictor page appears that will take 4 symtomps and predict the disease

### Disease Prediction from Symptoms
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.

### Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:
###### Naive Bayes
###### Decision Tree
###### Random Forest
###### Gradient Boosting

## Dataset
### Source-1
The dataset for this problem used with the main.py script is downloaded from here:

This dataset has 133 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patiend and last column in prognosis for the same.
