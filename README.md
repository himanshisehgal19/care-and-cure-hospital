### Disease Prediction from Symptoms
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.

### Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:
###### Naive Bayes
###### Random Forest
###### SVM

## Dataset
### Source-1
The dataset for this problem used with the main.py script is downloaded from here:

####### https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
This dataset has 133 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patiend and last column in prognosis for the same.
### After Prediction of Disease of Patient 
After the Disease is predicted a button of  'for more details ' appear that will tell the details of that particular disease by using Web Scrapping.

Also food tha  should be consumed  during this disease along with that the preventions from that disease that is used for better recovery.

 ### Doctor Login
 Each and Every doctor of the hospital have their own login credentials after loging in a doctor can check its appointments example:

Also doctors can predict disease via 4 symptoms and in details he/she can even look for medications and food items that can be advised to a patient suffering from a particular disease.

 The images in the above image are extracted via image scrapping.

USed Web scrapping for food deatils.

## Web Scrapping
Web Scripting is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites.
